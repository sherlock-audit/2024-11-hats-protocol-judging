# DoS Attack by Malicious Signer in HatsSignerGate

### Summary

Malicious signer, who have already been revoked the signer hat but have not been removed yet, can submit a signature to Safe transaction, resulting in the transaction revert.

### Root Cause

In the `HatsSignerGate::checkTransaction` function have a check to make sure that have enough valid signatures to execute the transaction.

[HatsSignerGate::checkTransaction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/49de29508904e95b3cfaaf27d2e76c527429c019/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L400) function:
```javascript
function checkTransaction(
  ...
  bytes memory signatures,
  ...
) public override {
  ...
  // count the number of valid signatures and revert if there aren't enough
=>if (_countValidSignatures(txHash, signatures, threshold) < threshold) revert InsufficientValidSignatures();
}
```

The `_countValidSignatures(txHash, signatures, threshold) < threshold` condition will happen when have one signer, who submit one signature in the list `signatures`, currently is not the wearer of the registered hat and haven't removed yet. As a result, the transaction will revert.

[HatsSignerGate::_countValidSignatures](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/49de29508904e95b3cfaaf27d2e76c527429c019/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L644) function:
```javascript
function _countValidSignatures(bytes32 dataHash, bytes memory signatures, uint256 sigCount)
  internal
  view
  returns (uint256 validSigCount)
{
  ...
  for (i; i < sigCount; ++i) {
    ...
=>  if (isValidSigner(currentOwner)) {
      unchecked {
        ++validSigCount;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious signer, who have already been revoked the signer hat but have not been removed yet, submit a signature to Safe transaction.
2. This cause the `HatsSignerGate::checkTransaction` function revert and the transaction revert too.

### Impact

Malicious signer can DOS the transaction execute until them is removed.
