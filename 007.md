# Signers can bypass HSG's guard in case it disallows them to do certain action

### Summary
In case a guard has been attached to the HSG, it makes sure to verify any transaction coming through. Ideally, as HSG is never meant to be removed as a Safe guard, any Safe transaction should be verified with the HSG and therefore HSG's guard should also check it too. However, this is not the case. 

```solidity
    // module guard preflight check
    if (guard != address(0)) {
      BaseGuard(guard).checkTransaction(
        to,
        value,
        data,
        operation,
        // Zero out the redundant transaction information only used for Safe multisig transctions.
        0,
        0,
        0,
        address(0),
        payable(0),
        "",
        address(0)
      );
    }
```

Currently the restrictions are as follows:
1. HSG's guard checks tx data pre-flight
2. HSG stores the current Safe state pre-flight
3. HSG checks the current Safe state post-flight.

This allows for a temporary change within the Safe between steps 2) and 3). What signers are able to do is
1. Disable HSG as a guard 
2. Execute any tx they want. Since HSG is disabled, HSG's guard never checks the transaction and never enforces its restrictions
3. Re-enable HSG as a guard.

### Root Cause
Not properly enforced restrictions

### Affected Code 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L464

### Attack Path
1. DAO has a restriction to not move any allocated tokens from their Safe. This is enforced by the set HSG guard blocking any calls to token's address.
2. DAO signs a delegatecall transaction which temporarily disables HSG as a guard, transfers the tokens, and the re-enables the HSG as a guard.
3. All of the post-flight checks succeed.
4. DAO has managed to bypass intended restrictions

### Impact
Bypassing HSG's guard.

### Mitigation

Fix is non-trivial.
