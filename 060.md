# it uses invalid “transient” variables causing logic errors.

### Summary

The function that contains a logical error is checkTransaction(). The logical error stems from the misuse of the keyword transient in the variable declarations. In Solidity, the transient keyword does not exist. All state variables declared at the contract level are stored in storage, and their values persist between transactions.

### Root Cause

In the checkTransaction() function, these variables are intended to be temporary and only valid during a single transaction execution. However, because they are declared as state variables without proper handling (the transient keyword is not recognized), they persist between transactions. This can cause incorrect behavior, especially with the reentrancy guard and state checks, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the logical error is that the variables intended to be temporary are, in fact, persistent, which can lead to incorrect execution logic in the checkTransaction() function.
