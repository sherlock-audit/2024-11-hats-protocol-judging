# Users can bypass intended restrictions and add modules to the Safe

### Summary
If the call intended to be executed is a `delegatecall`, the contract's `checkTransaction` stores the current list of owners. Then in the `checkAfterExecution` it verifies that the list  has not changed. The `checkAfterExecution` function also checks that no modules have been added.

```solidity
    if (operation == Enum.Operation.DelegateCall) {
      // case: DELEGATECALL
      // We disallow delegatecalls to unapproved targets
      if (!enabledDelegatecallTargets[to]) revert DelegatecallTargetNotEnabled();

      // Otherwise record the existing owners and threshold for post-flight checks to ensure that Safe state has not
      // been altered
      _existingOwnersHash = keccak256(abi.encode(owners));
      _existingThreshold = threshold;
      _existingFallbackHandler = safe.getSafeFallbackHandler();
```

However, both of these assume that the owner or module to be added is added to the regular functions, which uses an array as a sorted list. The `delegatecall` however allows to simply bypass the intended functions and change the mapping values in such way that an address is given owner rights without actually being in that ordered list. 

This renders the following checks useless.

### Attack Path

1. Signers do a `delegatecall` 
2. Said delegatecall adds a module by simply setting the storage value `modules[moduleAddr] = randomAddr`
3. This will bypass the `checkAfterExecution` checks and renders them useless.

Also breaks the following invariant which should never be broken
> There should never be more than 1 module enabled on the safe

### Impact
Users can bypass intended restrictions 

### Mitigation
Fix is non-trivial.
