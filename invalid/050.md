# Persistent _entrancyCounter Leads to Denial of Service (DoS)

### Summary

The failure to reset the _entrancyCounter after a transaction completion will cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for Safe users, as subsequent transactions will always fail the reentrancy check. This allows  to block the Safe from processing further transactions.

### Root Cause

-In the `checkTransaction():HatsSignerGate.sol`, `_entrancyCounter` is incremented during transaction execution , but there is no mechanism to reset it once the transaction is completed. This violates the expected behavior of the reentrancy guard mechanism.
-For example:
In `_beforeExecTransactionFromModule()`
```solidity
if (_entrancyCounter > 0 || _reentrancyGuard == 1) revert NoReentryAllowed();
```
The `_entrancyCounter` is not reset after processing, causing all subsequent transactions to revert unnecessarily.

### Internal pre-conditions

-A Safe transaction must increment `_entrancyCounter` through checkTransaction() 
```solidity
  // increment the entrancy count
    _entrancyCounter++;
  ```
-The `_entrancyCounter` value persists across transactions.

### External pre-conditions

-No explicit calls to reset `_entrancyCounter` 
-Multiple transactions are attempted using the Safe.

### Attack Path

-No explicit calls to reset `_entrancyCounter` are made by external modules or the Safe.
-Multiple transactions are attempted using the Safe.

### Impact

-The Safe becomes unusable as all subsequent transactions fail due to the persistent `_entrancyCounter`.

Affected Parties: All Safe users.
Impact: Denial of Service, preventing any transaction execution.

### PoC

Deploy the following contract in Remix or a testing environment to simulate the vulnerability:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SafeGuardMock {
    uint256 private _entrancyCounter = 0; // Tracks the number of times checkTransaction is called
    uint256 private _reentrancyGuard = 0;

    function checkTransaction() public {
        // Simulate the reentrancy prevention logic
        if (_entrancyCounter > 0 || _reentrancyGuard == 1) revert("NoReentryAllowed");

        // Increment the counter as part of transaction processing
        _entrancyCounter++;
    }

    function executeTransaction() public {
        // Simulate calling checkTransaction during a Safe transaction
        checkTransaction();

        // Transaction processing logic here...

        // BUG: _entrancyCounter is NOT reset here
    }

    function resetCounter() public {
        // Optional: Reset for demonstration (e.g., fix for the bug)
        _entrancyCounter = 0;
    }
}
```
1-Deploy the SafeGuardMock contract.
2-Call executeTransaction() once.
3-Observe that it executes successfully and increments _entrancyCounter to 1.
4-Call executeTransaction() again.
- Observe that it fails with the error `NoReentryAllowed because _entrancyCounter is not reset`.

5-Optionally, call resetCounter() and then call executeTransaction() to confirm the mitigation.


### Mitigation

Add logic to reset _entrancyCounter after each transaction is completed. For example:
```solidity
function checkTransaction() public {
 
    // Transaction processing logic...

    // Reset the counter after transaction completion
    _entrancyCounter = 0;
}
```
