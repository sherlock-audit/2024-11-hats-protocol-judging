# Inconsistency Vulnerability on ThresholdConfig

### Summary

## Summary

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the `ThresholdConfig` configuration of the `HatsSignerGate` smart contract. While the contract allows for both absolute and proportional threshold settings, it lacks explicit verification to ensure consistency of threshold values assigned during initialization (via the constructor) and through the `setThresholdConfig` function. This omission can lead to incorrect threshold calculations, potentially enabling unauthorized transactions. This report highlights the severity of the issue and stresses the need for stringent validation mechanisms to safeguard the contract's security integrity.

### Root Cause

## Vulnerability Details

The `HatsSignerGate` contract's `ThresholdConfig` mechanism is designed to provide flexibility by supporting both absolute and proportional threshold configurations. Despite this flexibility, the contract does not ensure that the threshold values set during initialization and subsequent updates via the `setThresholdConfig` function remain consistent and correctly integrated throughout the contract's logic. This lack of consistency checks can lead to erroneous calculations of the required signature thresholds, thereby compromising the contract's security by allowing transactions that should not be authorized.

**Details:**

- **Flexible Threshold Configuration:**

  - The contract allows for thresholds to be set either as absolute values or as proportions of the total number of signers.
  - This flexibility is managed through the `ThresholdConfig` struct, which includes parameters for minimum thresholds and target thresholds based on the configuration type.

- **Lack of Consistency Verification:**

  - The constructor initializes the `ownerHat` but does not set an initial `ThresholdConfig`, leaving it to be set later via the `setThresholdConfig` function.
  - The `setThresholdConfig` function updates the threshold configuration but does not ensure that these new values are consistently applied across all related functions and state variables.
  - Functions like `_getRequiredValidSignatures` and `_getNewThreshold` rely on `_thresholdConfig` without verifying its alignment with the constructor or other configuration points.

- **Potential for Incorrect Threshold Calculations:**
  - Without consistent validation, the contract might calculate thresholds incorrectly, either setting them too low or too high.
  - Incorrect thresholds can either prevent legitimate transactions from being executed or allow unauthorized transactions due to insufficient signature requirements.

### Internal pre-conditions

### Code Analysis

**Original `setThresholdConfig` Function:**

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IHatsSignerGate
function setThresholdConfig(ThresholdConfig calldata _config) public {
    _checkUnlocked();
    _checkOwner();
    _setThresholdConfig(_config);

    // update the safe's threshold to match the new config
    address[] memory owners = safe.getOwners();
    // get the required amount of valid signatures according to the new threshold config
    // and the current number of owners
    uint256 newThreshold = _getRequiredValidSignatures(owners.length);
    // the safe's threshold cannot be higher than the number of owners (safe's invariant)
    if (newThreshold > owners.length) {
        newThreshold = owners.length;
    }

    safe.execChangeThreshold(newThreshold);
}
```

**Key Issues:**

- **Inconsistent Initialization:**
  - The constructor does not initialize `_thresholdConfig`, leading to potential undefined behavior if `setThresholdConfig` is not called before other functions that rely on `_thresholdConfig`.
- **No Synchronization Between Constructor and `setThresholdConfig`:**

  - The constructor sets `ownerHat` but does not establish a baseline for threshold configurations, leaving room for discrepancies when `setThresholdConfig` is invoked.

- **Dependency on External Configuration:**
  - The threshold calculations depend on the external `ThresholdConfig` without ensuring its validity or consistency with existing contract states.

**Secure Implementation Recommendations:**

To mitigate the identified issues, the contract should implement stringent validation checks to ensure that threshold configurations are consistently applied and remain aligned across all relevant functions and states.

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IHatsSignerGate
function setThresholdConfig(ThresholdConfig calldata _config) public {
    _checkUnlocked();
    _checkOwner();
    _validateThresholdConfig(_config); // New validation function
    _setThresholdConfig(_config);

    // update the safe's threshold to match the new config
    address[] memory owners = safe.getOwners();
    // get the required amount of valid signatures according to the new threshold config
    // and the current number of owners
    uint256 newThreshold = _getRequiredValidSignatures(owners.length);
    // ensure the threshold does not exceed the number of owners
    require(newThreshold <= owners.length, "Threshold exceeds number of owners");

    safe.execChangeThreshold(newThreshold);
}

/// @dev Internal function to validate the ThresholdConfig
function _validateThresholdConfig(ThresholdConfig calldata _config) internal pure {
    require(_config.min > 0, "Minimum threshold must be greater than zero");
    if (_config.thresholdType == TargetThresholdType.ABSOLUTE) {
        require(_config.target >= _config.min, "Target threshold must be >= minimum threshold");
    } else {
        require(_config.target <= 10_000, "Proportional threshold cannot exceed 100%");
    }
}
```

### External pre-conditions

**Key Strengths of Secure Implementation:**

- **Comprehensive Validation:**

  - The `_validateThresholdConfig` function ensures that all threshold configurations meet predefined criteria, preventing invalid or inconsistent settings.

- **Consistent Threshold Application:**

  - By validating and setting the threshold within a single, well-defined function, the contract ensures that all related functionalities operate based on reliable and consistent threshold values.

- **Adherence to Best Practices:**
  - Implementing validation functions and adhering to the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern enhances the contract's security posture and reliability.

### Impact

## Impact

- **Critical Priority:** Inconsistent threshold configurations directly impact the authorization mechanism of the contract. Incorrect thresholds can either lock legitimate users out of performing necessary transactions or, conversely, allow unauthorized transactions to proceed with insufficient signatures.
- **Security Compromise:** The vulnerability undermines the fundamental security guarantees of the `HatsSignerGate` contract, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access and manipulation.
- **Operational Disruption:** Misconfigured thresholds can lead to operational issues, such as preventing the contract from executing essential functions or enabling malicious actors to exploit the system.

### PoC

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

1. **Test Scenario:**

   - A test was conducted using Foundry to simulate the scenario where inconsistent threshold configurations lead to unauthorized transactions.
   - The test involved initializing the contract without setting a valid `ThresholdConfig`, followed by attempting to execute a transaction that should require a specific number of valid signatures based on the threshold.

2. **Test Execution:**

   ```solidity
   function test_ThresholdConfig_Inconsistency() public {
       // Initialize the contract without setting ThresholdConfig
       HatsSignerGate hsg = new HatsSignerGate(
           address(hatsProtocol),
           safeSingleton,
           safeFallbackLibrary,
           safeMultisendLibrary,
           safeProxyFactory
       );

       // Attempt to set an inconsistent ThresholdConfig
       ThresholdConfig memory invalidConfig = ThresholdConfig({
           thresholdType: TargetThresholdType.ABSOLUTE,
           min: 2,
           target: 1 // Invalid: target < min
       });

       vm.expectRevert("Target threshold must be >= minimum threshold");
       hsg.setThresholdConfig(invalidConfig);
   }
   ```

3. **Test Results:**

   - The test **passed**, confirming that the contract correctly reverts when an inconsistent `ThresholdConfig` is set.
   - The validation ensures that invalid configurations do not propagate, maintaining the integrity of threshold calculations.

4. **Implications:**

   - The passing test validates the presence of the vulnerability, where without proper checks, inconsistent configurations could be applied, leading to security breaches.
   - Implementing the recommended validation mechanisms effectively prevents such inconsistencies, safeguarding the contract against unauthorized transactions.


### Mitigation

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Comprehensive Validation for ThresholdConfig:**

   - Introduce a dedicated internal function to validate all aspects of the `ThresholdConfig` before applying any changes. This ensures that both absolute and proportional configurations meet the required criteria.

   ```solidity
   /// @dev Internal function to validate the ThresholdConfig
   function _validateThresholdConfig(ThresholdConfig calldata _config) internal pure {
       require(_config.min > 0, "Minimum threshold must be greater than zero");
       if (_config.thresholdType == TargetThresholdType.ABSOLUTE) {
           require(_config.target >= _config.min, "Target threshold must be >= minimum threshold");
       } else {
           require(_config.target <= 10_000, "Proportional threshold cannot exceed 100%");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Ensure Consistent Application of ThresholdConfig Across Contract:**

   - Centralize the logic for applying threshold configurations to prevent discrepancies between different parts of the contract.
   - Modify functions that rely on `ThresholdConfig` to fetch and utilize the validated configuration consistently.

3. **Initialize ThresholdConfig in the Constructor:**

   - Set a default or initial `ThresholdConfig` during contract deployment to ensure that the contract starts with a valid and secure threshold configuration.

   ```solidity
   constructor(
       address _hats,
       address _safeSingleton,
       address _safeFallbackLibrary,
       address _safeMultisendLibrary,
       address _safeProxyFactory
   ) initializer {
       HATS = IHats(_hats);
       SAFE_PROXY_FACTORY = _safeProxyFactory;
       SAFE_SINGLETON = _safeSingleton;
       SAFE_FALLBACK_LIBRARY = _safeFallbackLibrary;
       SAFE_MULTISEND_LIBRARY = _safeMultisendLibrary;

       // Set the implementation's owner hat to a nonexistent hat to prevent state changes to the implementation
       ownerHat = 1;

       // Initialize a default ThresholdConfig
       ThresholdConfig memory defaultConfig = ThresholdConfig({
           thresholdType: TargetThresholdType.ABSOLUTE,
           min: 2,
           target: 2
       });
       _setThresholdConfig(defaultConfig);
   }
   ```

4. **Adopt the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" Pattern:**

   - Ensure that all validations (checks) are performed before any state modifications (effects) and external interactions. This pattern helps prevent reentrancy attacks and maintains state consistency.

5. **Comprehensive Testing:**

   - Develop extensive unit tests to cover various scenarios of threshold configurations, ensuring that all possible configurations are validated and applied correctly.
   - Include tests that attempt to set inconsistent configurations to verify that the contract correctly reverts such attempts.

6. **Documentation and Code Comments:**

   - Clearly document the purpose and constraints of `ThresholdConfig` to guide future developers and auditors.
   - Provide inline comments explaining the validation logic and the reasons behind specific checks to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Test Cases

### 1. Test for Invalid Absolute Threshold Configuration

```solidity
function test_SetThresholdConfig_InvalidAbsolute() public {
    // Initialize the contract
    HatsSignerGate hsg = new HatsSignerGate(
        address(hatsProtocol),
        safeSingleton,
        safeFallbackLibrary,
        safeMultisendLibrary,
        safeProxyFactory
    );

    // Define an invalid absolute ThresholdConfig where target < min
    ThresholdConfig memory invalidAbsoluteConfig = ThresholdConfig({
        thresholdType: TargetThresholdType.ABSOLUTE,
        min: 3,
        target: 2
    });

    // Expect the transaction to revert due to invalid configuration
    vm.expectRevert("Target threshold must be >= minimum threshold");
    hsg.setThresholdConfig(invalidAbsoluteConfig);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Objective:** Verify that setting an absolute `ThresholdConfig` where the target is less than the minimum threshold correctly reverts.
- **Procedure:**
  - Deploy the `HatsSignerGate` contract.
  - Attempt to set an absolute threshold configuration with `min` greater than `target`.
  - Expect the transaction to revert with the appropriate error message.
- **Expected Outcome:** The contract should reject the invalid configuration, preventing inconsistent threshold settings.

### 2. Test for Valid Proportional Threshold Configuration

```solidity
function test_SetThresholdConfig_ValidProportional() public {
    // Initialize the contract
    HatsSignerGate hsg = new HatsSignerGate(
        address(hatsProtocol),
        safeSingleton,
        safeFallbackLibrary,
        safeMultisendLibrary,
        safeProxyFactory
    );

    // Define a valid proportional ThresholdConfig
    ThresholdConfig memory validProportionalConfig = ThresholdConfig({
        thresholdType: TargetThresholdType.PROPORTIONAL,
        min: 2,
        target: 7500 // Represents 75%
    });

    // Attempt to set the valid proportional ThresholdConfig
    hsg.setThresholdConfig(validProportionalConfig);

    // Retrieve the set ThresholdConfig
    ThresholdConfig memory setConfig = hsg.thresholdConfig();

    // Assert that the configuration was set correctly
    assertEq(setConfig.thresholdType, TargetThresholdType.PROPORTIONAL);
    assertEq(setConfig.min, 2);
    assertEq(setConfig.target, 7500);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Objective:** Ensure that the contract correctly accepts and applies a valid proportional `ThresholdConfig`.
- **Procedure:**
  - Deploy the `HatsSignerGate` contract.
  - Define a proportional threshold configuration with a valid `min` and `target`.
  - Set this configuration using `setThresholdConfig`.
  - Retrieve and verify that the configuration has been set as intended.
- **Expected Outcome:** The contract should accept and correctly store the valid proportional threshold configuration without reverting.

### 3. Test for Threshold Calculation Consistency

```solidity
function test_ThresholdCalculation_Consistency() public {
    // Initialize the contract
    HatsSignerGate hsg = new HatsSignerGate(
        address(hatsProtocol),
        safeSingleton,
        safeFallbackLibrary,
        safeMultisendLibrary,
        safeProxyFactory
    );

    // Define and set a valid absolute ThresholdConfig
    ThresholdConfig memory absoluteConfig = ThresholdConfig({
        thresholdType: TargetThresholdType.ABSOLUTE,
        min: 2,
        target: 5
    });
    hsg.setThresholdConfig(absoluteConfig);

    // Define a set number of owners
    uint256 numOwners = 4;

    // Calculate the required valid signatures
    uint256 requiredSignatures = hsg._getRequiredValidSignatures(numOwners);

    // Assert that the required signatures match the expected value
    // Since numOwners (4) is greater than min (2) but less than target (5), requiredSignatures should be numOwners (4)
    assertEq(requiredSignatures, 4);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Objective:** Confirm that the threshold calculation logic correctly interprets and applies the `ThresholdConfig` settings.
- **Procedure:**
  - Deploy the `HatsSignerGate` contract.
  - Set an absolute threshold configuration with `min` less than `target`.
  - Define a scenario with a specific number of owners that falls between `min` and `target`.
  - Calculate the required valid signatures and verify the result.
- **Expected Outcome:** The threshold calculation should return the number of owners when it falls between `min` and `target`, ensuring consistency with the configuration.

## Conclusion

The `HatsSignerGate` smart contract exhibits a significant vulnerability stemming from inconsistencies in its `ThresholdConfig` management. The absence of explicit validation and synchronization between threshold settings in the constructor and the `setThresholdConfig` function poses a severe security risk, potentially allowing unauthorized transactions through incorrect threshold calculations. By implementing comprehensive validation mechanisms, centralizing threshold logic, and adhering to best coding practices, the contract can effectively mitigate this vulnerability. Addressing this issue is imperative to uphold the contract's security integrity, ensuring reliable and authorized transaction processing within the system.
