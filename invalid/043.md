# Attacker will cause inconsistent threshold calculations, enabling unauthorized transactions for users

### Summary

The duplication of threshold calculation logic will cause inconsistent threshold values for users as an **attacker** will exploit these inconsistencies to authorize unauthorized transactions.

### Root Cause

In the `HatsSignerGate` contract, the functions `_getRequiredValidSignatures` and `_getNewThreshold` are implemented separately within multiple functions such as `claimSignersFor` and `setThresholdConfig`. This duplication introduces redundant logic and increases the risk of inconsistencies if the threshold calculation methodology changes in one instance but not in others.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract’s constructor does not initialize `_thresholdConfig`, allowing it to be set later via the `setThresholdConfig` function.
2. An **attacker** gains the necessary permissions to call the `setThresholdConfig` function.
3. Threshold calculation functions (`_getRequiredValidSignatures` and `_getNewThreshold`) are duplicated across multiple contract functions without centralization.

### External pre-conditions

1. The Hats Protocol allows threshold configurations to be modified by authorized users without additional safeguards.
2. There are no external mechanisms preventing the **attacker** from setting inconsistent threshold configurations.

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker** gains the necessary permissions to call the `setThresholdConfig` function.
2. **Attacker** invokes `setThresholdConfig` with a malicious `ThresholdConfig` that manipulates threshold values inconsistently.
3. Due to duplicated threshold calculation logic, some functions like `claimSignersFor` use outdated or inconsistent threshold values.
4. **Attacker** leverages these inconsistencies to authorize transactions without meeting the actual required signatures, bypassing authorization checks.

### Impact

The **users** suffer unauthorized transactions being executed, potentially leading to loss of funds or compromise of the contract’s security integrity.

        ThresholdConfig memory newConfig = ThresholdConfig({
            thresholdType: TargetThresholdType.PROPORTIONAL,
            min: 3,

        hsg.setThresholdConfig(newConfig);

        // Assuming claimSignersFor requires the correct number of signatures

}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Setup:**

   - Deploy mock contracts for `IHats` and `ISafe` interfaces.
   - Deploy the `HatsSignerGate` contract with valid addresses.

2. **Initialize Threshold Configuration:**

   - Set an initial proportional threshold configuration with a minimum of 2 and a target of 75%.

3. **Assign Hats to Signers:**

   - Assign hat ID `1` to two signers, `signer1` and `signer2`.

4. **Mocking for Inconsistency:**

   - Use `vm.mockCall` to mock the `_getNewThreshold` function to return an incorrect threshold value (`100`), simulating a scenario where one instance of the threshold calculation is altered independently.

5. **Update Threshold Configuration:**

   - Update the threshold configuration to a new proportional target of 80%.

6. **Attempt to Claim Signers:**
   - Have the signers attempt to claim signers for hat ID `1`. Due to the mocked inconsistent threshold, this should fail with an "Insufficient signatures" error, demonstrating the inconsistency introduced by duplicated logic.


### Mitigation

To effectively address and mitigate the **Threshold Calculation Duplication Vulnerability** in the `HatsSignerGate` contract, the following measures should be implemented:

1. **Centralize Threshold Calculation Logic:**
   
   - **Create a Single Internal Function:**
     - Develop a dedicated internal function, such as `_calculateThreshold`, that encapsulates all logic related to threshold calculations. This ensures that all parts of the contract reference the same, consistent logic for determining required signatures.
     
     ```solidity
     /// @dev Internal function to calculate threshold based on configuration
     function _calculateThreshold(uint256 ownerCount, ThresholdConfig memory config) internal pure returns (uint256) {
         if (config.thresholdType == TargetThresholdType.ABSOLUTE) {
             return config.target >= config.min ? config.target : config.min;
         } else {
             return (ownerCount * config.target) / 10000;
         }
     }
     ```
   
   - **Refactor Existing Functions:**
     - Modify all functions that previously contained duplicated threshold calculation logic (e.g., `claimSignersFor`, `setThresholdConfig`) to utilize the centralized `_calculateThreshold` function. This eliminates redundancy and ensures consistency across the contract.
     
     ```solidity
     /// @inheritdoc IHatsSignerGate
     function setThresholdConfig(ThresholdConfig calldata _config) public {
         _checkUnlocked();
         _checkOwner();
         _validateThresholdConfig(_config); // Validation as previously implemented
         _setThresholdConfig(_config);
     
         // Update the safe's threshold to match the new config
         address[] memory owners = safe.getOwners();
         uint256 newThreshold = _calculateThreshold(owners.length, _config);
         require(newThreshold <= owners.length, "Threshold exceeds number of owners");
     
         safe.execChangeThreshold(newThreshold);
     }
     
     /// @notice Claims signers for a specific hat
     function claimSignersFor(uint256 hatId) external {
         // ... some logic ...
     
         uint256 requiredSignatures = _calculateThreshold(currentOwners.length, currentConfig);
         require(userSignatures >= requiredSignatures, "Insufficient signatures");
     
         // ... execute claim ...
     }
     ```

2. **Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle:**
   
   - **Eliminate Redundant Code:**
     - Ensure that no other parts of the contract contain similar or identical threshold calculation logic. All references should point to the centralized function to maintain consistency and reduce the risk of discrepancies.
   
   - **Promote Code Reusability:**
     - Utilize modifiers or additional internal functions if necessary to handle repetitive tasks related to threshold management, further enhancing code maintainability.

3. **Implement Comprehensive Validation Checks:**
   
   - **Validate Threshold Configurations:**
     - As previously outlined, ensure that all threshold configurations are validated before being set. This prevents the assignment of inconsistent or malicious threshold values.
   
   - **Ensure Consistent State Updates:**
     - Guarantee that any state changes related to thresholds occur through the centralized function, maintaining a single source of truth for threshold values.

4. **Enhance Unit Testing and Code Audits:**
   
   - **Develop Extensive Unit Tests:**
     - Create comprehensive tests that cover various scenarios of threshold configurations, ensuring that the centralized `_calculateThreshold` function behaves as expected under all conditions.
   
   - **Simulate Attack Scenarios:**
     - Include tests that attempt to exploit potential inconsistencies, verifying that the mitigation effectively prevents unauthorized transactions.
   
   - **Conduct Regular Code Audits:**
     - Engage in periodic code reviews and security audits to identify and rectify any emerging vulnerabilities, ensuring the contract remains secure against evolving threats.

5. **Adopt Best Coding Practices:**
   
   - **Modular Design:**
     - Structure the contract in a modular fashion, separating distinct functionalities into well-defined modules or contracts. This enhances readability and simplifies maintenance.
   
   - **Documentation and Code Comments:**
     - Provide clear documentation and inline comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the centralized threshold calculation function. This aids future developers and auditors in understanding the contract's logic and reduces the likelihood of inadvertent errors during updates.

6. **Implement the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" Pattern:**
   
   - **Order of Operations:**
     - Ensure that all necessary validations (checks) are performed before making any state changes (effects) or interacting with external contracts (interactions). This pattern minimizes the risk of reentrancy attacks and maintains contract integrity.

     ```solidity
     /// @inheritdoc IHatsSignerGate
     function setThresholdConfig(ThresholdConfig calldata _config) public {
         // Checks
         _checkUnlocked();
         _checkOwner();
         _validateThresholdConfig(_config);
         
         // Effects
         _setThresholdConfig(_config);
     
         // Interactions
         address[] memory owners = safe.getOwners();
         uint256 newThreshold = _calculateThreshold(owners.length, _config);
         require(newThreshold <= owners.length, "Threshold exceeds number of owners");
     
         safe.execChangeThreshold(newThreshold);
     }
     ```

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the `HatsSignerGate` contract will achieve enhanced security and reliability. Centralizing the threshold calculation logic not only resolves the immediate vulnerability but also fortifies the contract against future inconsistencies and potential exploits. Adhering to best practices and maintaining rigorous testing and auditing protocols ensures the contract remains robust and trustworthy for all stakeholders.
