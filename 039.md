# Cross-chain replay attack vulnerability

### Summary

`Signatures` needed to execute a transaction can be reused on another chain if several conditions are satisfied

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L644-L684


The `HatsSignerGate.sol::_countValidSignatures` to check `signatures` validity uses `ecrecover` function that is subject to cross-chain replay attack.

```Solidity
  function _countValidSignatures(bytes32 dataHash, bytes memory signatures, uint256 sigCount)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 validSigCount)
  {
    // There cannot be an owner with address 0.
    address currentOwner;
    uint8 v;
    bytes32 r;
    bytes32 s;
    uint256 i;

    for (i; i < sigCount; ++i) {
      (v, r, s) = signatureSplit(signatures, i);
      if (v == 0) {
        // If v is 0 then it is a contract signature
        // When handling contract signatures the address of the contract is encoded into r
        currentOwner = address(uint160(uint256(r)));
      } else if (v == 1) {
        // If v is 1 then it is an approved hash
        // When handling approved hashes the address of the approver is encoded into r
        currentOwner = address(uint160(uint256(r)));
      } else if (v > 30) {
        // If v > 30 then default va (27,28) has been adjusted for eth_sign flow
        // To support eth_sign and similar we adjust v and hash the messageHash with the Ethereum message prefix before
        // applying ecrecover
        currentOwner = ecrecover(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", dataHash)), v - 4, r, s);
      } else {
        // Default is the ecrecover flow with the provided data hash
        // Use ecrecover with the messageHash for EOA signatures
@>        currentOwner = ecrecover(dataHash, v, r, s);
      }

      if (isValidSigner(currentOwner)) {
        // shouldn't overflow given reasonable sigCount
        unchecked {
          ++validSigCount;
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

`Safe.sol, HatsSignerGate.sol` deployed on two blockchains so that:
`Safe.nonce() chain A > Safe.nonce() chain B` and the `signatures` have been already used in a transaction in chain A

### External pre-conditions

An attacker that takes signatures through the block explorer and use them in another chain (aforementioned chain B) when the `Safe.nonce()` value will be equal to the one used in chain A

### Attack Path

The attacker could get from a block explorer the signatures used on one chain and replay them on another chain that has a lower `nonce` value when it will be equal to the `nonce` used in the OG transaction (first chain).

### Impact

Permissions to execute a transaction coming from the `Safe` contract can be bypassed replaying `signatures` already used in another transaction on a different chain when the `Safe.nonce()` values are the same.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use ECDSA library functions
