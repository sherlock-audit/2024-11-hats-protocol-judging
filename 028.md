# Permanent Lock vulnerability in HatsSignerGate contract

### Summary

The absence of a function to unlock the `HatsSignerGate` contract results in a permanent locked state. Once locked, the contract cannot be unlocked, preventing the owner from calling permissioned functions.

### Root Cause

In the `HatsSignerGate` contract, once the `locked` state is set to `true`, there is no mechanism to reset it to `false`. This leads to the contract being permanently locked, rendering the owner unable to perform actions that require permission.

[HatsSignerGate::_lock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/49de29508904e95b3cfaaf27d2e76c527429c019/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L811) function:
```javascript
function _lock() internal {
  locked = true;
  emit HSGLocked();
}
```

### Impact

The `HatsSignerGate` contract becomes permanently locked, making all permissioned functions inaccessible to the owner.

### Mitigation

Add a function to change the `locked` state back to `false`. This function should be restricted to the owner of the contract to ensure secure and intentional unlocking.
