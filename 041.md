# High Number of signers can make the Safe unusable.

### Summary

In the Current `HatsSignerGate` Implementation there is no upper limit on the number of Signers. Anyone with a signer hat can claim signer and are hard to remove. Therefore increasing the `threshold` to a large number where making any descisions on transactions would prove extremely difficult.

### Root Cause


As Number of owners is uncapped and `getNewThreshold()` relies on `getRequiredValidSignatures(numowners)` which is inturn used to calculate required signatures based on number of owners, When number of owners is extremely high, threshold also increases which can lead to problems with governance.eg:

```sol
 if (numOwners > config.target) _requiredValidSignatures = config.target;

```

here required signatures will be `config.target` but if actual number of signers is way higher than `config.target` required signatures would be disproportional to number of owners.
