# Single hatId Assigned to Multiple Wearers Enables Governance Manipulation

### Summary

When a single hatId (e.g., ownerHat) is assigned to multiple users, and some of these users also hold a signerHat, the overlap creates a critical vulnerability. It allows malicious actors to reduce thresholds or manipulate governance by exploiting their dual roles. This breaks the intended separation of roles and undermines the protocolâ€™s security model.

### Root Cause

The protocol fails to enforce strict separation between ownership (ownerHat) and signing authority (signerHat). A single wearer assigned both roles can act unilaterally to modify governance parameters or approve malicious transactions ( call all ownerhat function) .

### Internal pre-conditions

1-A single hatId (e.g., ownerHat) is assigned to multiple wearers.
2-At least one wearer of ownerHat also holds a signerHat ( safe owner).

### External pre-conditions

A user with overlapping roles executes governance actions, such as reducing thresholds.

### Attack Path

1-Assign `ownerHat` and `signerHat` to the same user (e.g., Alice).
2-Alice, acting as an owner, reduces the threshold to 1 using `setThresholdConfig()` .
3-Alice, acting as a signer, approves malicious transactions with no additional checks due to the reduced threshold.
4-Governance checks are bypassed, allowing unauthorized actions.

### Impact

-Severity: High
-Attack Surface: Governance manipulation ( the signer can call all ownerhat function) , unauthorized approvals
-Affected Components: HatsSignerGate governance and transaction approval

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Add a validation mechanism in the governance logic:
```solidity
require(!isOwnerAndSigner(msg.sender), "Cannot hold both ownerHat and signerHat");
```
Alternatively, introduce an additional approval layer for sensitive actions like modifying thresholds.
