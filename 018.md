# Missing signature validation

### Summary

In the `_countValidSignatures` function, anyone can craft valid signatures.

### Root Cause

In [`HatsSignerGate.sol:656-683`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L656-L683), in the cases where v=0 and v=1, the contract logic miss some validations.
```solidity
      if (v == 0) {
        // If v is 0 then it is a contract signature
        // When handling contract signatures the address of the contract is encoded into r
        currentOwner = address(uint160(uint256(r)));
      } else if (v == 1) {
        // If v is 1 then it is an approved hash
        // When handling approved hashes the address of the approver is encoded into r
        currentOwner = address(uint160(uint256(r)));
      }
```
Anyone can easily send a signature with the `r` he wants, so with a valid signer who has not signed the `dataHash`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A valid signer send fake signatures with `v=0` or `v=1`, and `r` as a valid signer.
2. The `checkTransaction` calls the internal `_countValidSignatures` function.
3. The function does not revert, count the fake signatures as valid and a malicious transaction is validated.

### Impact

Any malicious user can craft valid signatures.

### Mitigation

1. Add logic for the case where the signer is a smart contract (v=0). Follow the eip-1271.
2. Add logic for the case v=1 if wanted or revert in this case.
