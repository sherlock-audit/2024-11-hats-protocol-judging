# The _removeSigner function lacks validation to ensure that the signer being removed has no active responsibilities or critical roles in the system.

### Summary

The missing validation in the `_removeSigner` function can disrupt the system's functionality, as it may remove a signer who holds active responsibilities or critical roles within the Safe. This oversight occurs because the function directly removes a signer and deletes their associated data from registeredSignerHats, without ensuring that they are no longer required for ongoing tasks or vital system operations.

### Root Cause

[HatsSignerGate.sol#l756](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L756)

In the `_removeSigner` function (line X in the contract), the implementation removes a signer and deletes any associated data from registeredSignerHats, without checking whether:

1.The signer is still actively performing critical duties.
2.The signer has roles or responsibilities that are essential for the proper functioning of the Safe.

For instance:
A critical signer responsible for approving important transactions could be removed, causing a disruption.
Associated roles or data linked to the signer are deleted without verifying their current necessity.
This lack of validation can leave the system in an inconsistent or broken state.



### Internal pre-conditions

1.A signer `(_signer)` is registered in the Safe and has data stored in registeredSignerHats.
2.The signer is performing active tasks (e.g., transaction approval or serving as a required participant in a multi-signature process).
3.The `_removeSigner` function is called to remove the signer, without validating their responsibilities.


### Impact

If this issue is not addressed, the following consequences may occur:

Disruption of System Functionality: If the removed signer is critical to ongoing operations (e.g., approving transactions), the system may fail to execute necessary actions.
Loss of System Integrity: Removing a signer who is actively participating in the Safe or has important roles may leave the system in an invalid or inconsistent state.
Data Inconsistencies: Deleting the signer's associated data (registeredSignerHats) without validation can lead to a loss of important role-related information.


### PoC

A scenario illustrating how the lack of validation in `_removeSigner` can disrupt the system:

1.A Safe is initialized with a critical signer who is required for approving multi-signature transactions.
2.The `_removeSigner` function is called to remove this signer, without validating whether they have active roles or responsibilities.
3.The critical signer is removed, causing disruptions such as:
Incomplete transaction approvals.
Unmet quorum requirements for multi-signature operations.
Loss of associated role information in registeredSignerHats.

```solidity
contract Example {
    function testRemoval() public {
        address criticalSigner = 0x123...; // Assume this signer is essential for transaction approvals.
        _removeSigner(criticalSigner);    // This removes the critical signer without validation.
        // Subsequent transaction approvals may fail due to the missing signer.
    }
}
```

### Proposed Solution
To mitigate this issue, the `_removeSigne`r function must include proper validation to ensure that the signer being removed has no active responsibilities or critical roles.

Step 1: Add Validation Before Removal Include a `require` statement to validate that the signer has no active responsibilities:
```solidity
require(_signerHasNoActiveResponsibilities(_signer), "Signer has active responsibilities and cannot be removed");
```
Step 2: Implement a Helper Function Define a helper function to check the signer's status:
```solidity
function _signerHasNoActiveResponsibilities(address _signer) internal view returns (bool) {
    return registeredSignerHats[_signer] == 0 && !_isCriticalSigner(_signer);
}
```
Step 3: Define Critical Role Check Implement the _isCriticalSigner function to verify whether the signer has any critical roles in the system:
```solidity
function _isCriticalSigner(address _signer) internal view returns (bool) {
    // Example: Check if the signer is part of a quorum or required for specific actions
    return safe.isOwner(_signer) && safe.getOwners().length <= safe.getThreshold();
}
```
### Mitigation
1.Validation Layer: Ensure that the _removeSigner function validates the signer's responsibilities before performing the removal.
2.Role Management: Implement a clear system to track whether a signer is critical or has pending tasks before allowing their removal.
3.Failsafe Mechanism: If the signer cannot be removed safely, provide feedback to the system (e.g., via revert messages) to indicate why the removal is blocked.
