# _entrancyCounter Reentry check can be bypassed by modifying Safe.nonce value

### Summary

HSG has safeguards to prevent signers and modules changing the Safe state. For the `checkTransaction` flow it uses two layer approach:

1. Whitelist of `enabledDelegatecallTargets[]`.

2. On execution, HSG takes a snapshot of the safe state, and afterwards at `checkAfterExecution -> _checkSafeState` it verifies the state has not been tampered with.

The 2nd layer can be bypassed.

### Root Cause

HSG team correctly identified that a delegate call can invoke `checkTransaction` outside of the regular Safe flow, and in order to mitigate it they track `Safe.nonce` value:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L430

`we rely on the invariant that the Safe nonce increments every time Safe.execTransaction calls out to IGuard.checkTransaction`.

As such the following is mitigated:

```solidity
execTransaction -> checkTransaction
add owner
direct call checkTransaction - to update the snapshot
```

The direct call fails since `Safe.nonce` has not been incremented.

However the issue is that a delegated call can modify any Safe value, including the `nonce`, thus the attack becomes:

```solidity
execTransaction -> checkTransaction
add owner
modify nonce slot
direct call checkTransaction - to update the snapshot
```
