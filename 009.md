# Safe Wallet Compatibility Check Missing in setUp Function

### Summary

Hats contract allows to add an exist Safe Wallet. However, older versions of Safe (e.g., v1.2) do not support the Safe Guards feature, which leads to the Safe Wallet becoming non-functional. This issue can prevent critical operations dependent on the Safe Wallet. The lack of a compatibility check during the setUp process is a major oversight.

### Root Cause

<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L160-L199>
From above `setUp` function we can see there is lack of checking the version of the safe wallet.

Hats allows owner add an exist safe wallet instead of create a new safe wallet.
```solidity
    // deploy a new safe if there is no provided safe
    if (params.safe == address(0)) {
      params.safe = SafeManagerLib.deploySafeAndAttachHSG(
        SAFE_PROXY_FACTORY, SAFE_SINGLETON, SAFE_FALLBACK_LIBRARY, SAFE_MULTISEND_LIBRARY
      );
    }
```

According to safe docs:
<https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-guards>
>Safe Guards are introduced with Safe contracts version 1.3.0.

Hats contract allows owner to add safe guards:
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L910-L914>
```solidity
  function setGuard(address _guard) public {
    _checkUnlocked();
    _checkOwner();
    _setGuard(_guard);
  }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. use an exist safe wallet

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1.prevent critical operations dependent on the Safe Wallet

### PoC

```solidity
// deploy a new safe if there is no provided safe
    if (params.safe == address(0)) {
      params.safe = SafeManagerLib.deploySafeAndAttachHSG(
        SAFE_PROXY_FACTORY, SAFE_SINGLETON, SAFE_FALLBACK_LIBRARY, SAFE_MULTISEND_LIBRARY
      );
    }
```

### Mitigation

Check current safe version during `setUp`
