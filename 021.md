# Improper Threshold Update Allows Attacker to Gain Voting Control

### Summary

The ```claimSignersFor``` function allows an attacker to add multiple signers and manipulate the quorum before the voting threshold is updated. This vulnerability arises because the threshold recalculation occurs after new signers are registered and call is executed, enabling an attacker to register enough signers to exceed the quorum and execute arbitrary transactions.

### Root Cause

The function sequence adds signers and increases ownership and doing an execute call before recalculating the threshold. This improper ordering allows an attacker to exploit the mismatch between the current ownership and the threshold value.

```HatsSignerGate.sol``` function ```claimSignersFor```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls the ```claimSignersFor``` function with multiple ```_hatIds``` and corresponding ```_signers```.

2.Signers are registered and added as owners through ```_registerSigner``` and ```s.execSafeTransactionFromHSG``` calls.

3.During this process, the voting threshold is not recalculated, allowing the attacker to surpass the effective quorum required for executing transactions.

4.Once the attacker gains sufficient voting power, they can approve malicious transactions or modify contract states.

s.execSafeTransactionFromHSG(addOwnerData);  call gets executed and then the threshold gets updated.
Threshold needs to get updated in the else check Mitigation !

### Impact

The attacker can bypass governance thresholds since its not being updated before the executing the call, compromising the integrity of the voting system.
Unauthorized transactions can be executed, resulting in financial and functional loss to the protocol.
The contract's trust and security are critically undermined.


### PoC

Call ```claimSignersFor``` with ```_hatIds``` and  ```_signers``` arrays such that enough signers are added to exceed the current voting quorum.
Since the threshold is updated only after all signers are added, the attacker uses their newly acquired voting power to execute arbitrary transactions.

### Mitigation

in the else update the ```newNumOwners``` count then get the ```newThreshold``` and then do a ```execChangeThreshold``` call

Mitigation might not be correct but the concept is and this issue really exists
```solidity
function claimSignersFor(uint256[] calldata _hatIds, address[] calldata _signers) public {
    // check that signer permissions are claimable for
    if (!claimableFor) revert NotClaimableFor();

    // check that the arrays are the same length
    uint256 toClaimCount = _signers.length;
    if (_hatIds.length != toClaimCount) revert InvalidArrayLength();

    ISafe s = safe;
    // get the current threshold
    uint256 threshold = s.getThreshold();
    // get the current owners
    address[] memory owners = s.getOwners();

    // check if the only owner is this contract, meaning no owners have been added yet
    bool isInitialOwnersState = owners.length == 1 && owners[0] == address(this);

    // count the number of owners after the claim
    uint256 newNumOwners = owners.length;

    // iterate through the arrays, adding each signer
    for (uint256 i; i < toClaimCount; ++i) {
      uint256 hatId = _hatIds[i];
      address signer = _signers[i];

      // register the signer, reverting if invalid or already registered
      _registerSigner({ _hatToRegister: hatId, _signer: signer, _allowReregistration: false });

      // if the signer is not an owner, add them
      if (!s.isOwner(signer)) {
        // initiate the addOwnerData, to be conditionally set below
        bytes memory addOwnerData;

        // for the first signer, check if the only owner is this contract and swap it out if so
       if (i == 0 && isInitialOwnersState) {
          addOwnerData = SafeManagerLib.encodeSwapOwnerAction(SafeManagerLib.SENTINELS, address(this), signer);
        } else {
          newNumOwners++;
          uint256 newThreshold = _getNewThreshold(newNumOwners);
          if (newThreshold != threshold) {
          safe.execChangeThreshold(newThreshold);
          }
          addOwnerData = SafeManagerLib.encodeAddOwnerWithThresholdAction(signer, newThreshold);
        }

        // execute the call
        s.execSafeTransactionFromHSG(addOwnerData);
      }
    }
  }
```
