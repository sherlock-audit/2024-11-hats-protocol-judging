# `_countValidSignatures` Does Not Validate Approved Hashes Or Contract Signatures

### Summary

Insufficient signature validity checks result in unauthorized use of the Safe.

### Root Cause

The `_countValidSignatures` function in `HatsSignerGate` can be bypassed by an attacker to authorize malicious transactions.

Consider the following two cases:

```solidity
if (v == 0) {
        // If v is 0 then it is a contract signature
        // When handling contract signatures the address of the contract is encoded into r
        currentOwner = address(uint160(uint256(r)));
}
```

```solidity
else if (v == 1) {
        // If v is 1 then it is an approved hash
        // When handling approved hashes the address of the approver is encoded into r
        currentOwner = address(uint160(uint256(r)));
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/49de29508904e95b3cfaaf27d2e76c527429c019/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L662C9-L666C8

**Notice that the `_countValidSignatures` function will accept the `currentOwner` as the contents of the `r` parameter from the parsed signature array without validation.**

This means an attacker can simply create an array of mock signatures comprised of only the public addresses of valid owners in order to masquerade as them, since neither the approved hash or contract signature is actually validated for authenticity.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin authorizes HSG for their vault and uses a number of `registeredSignerHats` that exceeds the signing threshold.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker submits malicious payload using `signatures` calldata containing abi encoded `registeredSignerHats`addresses which enter only the [`v == 0` and `v == 1` cases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/49de29508904e95b3cfaaf27d2e76c527429c019/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L658C7-L666C8).

### Impact

Attackers can steal all funds from Safes that authorize the HSG.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The specified addresses **must be validated**.
