# Unauthorized Signer Registration in claimSignerFor/claimSignersFor

### Summary

The ```claimSignerFor``` function in the HatsSignerGate v2 contract lacks proper authorization checks, allowing any caller ```(msg.sender)``` to claim a hat for an arbitrary address ```(_signer)```. This creates a security vulnerability, as unauthorized entities can manipulate the signer registration process.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the absence of an authorization mechanism in the ```claimSignerFor``` function. Specifically:

No Validation of Caller ```(msg.sender)```
The function does not verify whether ```msg.sender``` is authorized to act on behalf of the ```_signer```. This allows any external caller to arbitrarily claim a hat for any address.

Assumption of Trust
The implementation assumes that either the system's claimableFor flag or the internal ```_registerSigner``` function will prevent unauthorized claims. However, neither of these mechanisms restrict who can call the function to register a signer for an arbitrary address.

Overlooked Caller-Authorization Model
The function's design implicitly assumes the caller ```(msg.sender)``` always has the right to manage the ```_signer```. This oversight introduces a critical gap, enabling exploitation by malicious actors.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The attacker begins calling ```claimSignerFor``` repeatedly, using their own address as the caller and specifying arbitrary target addresses as ```_signer```. Each call successfully registers the target address to the hat ```(_hatId)```, regardless of consent or authorization.

### Impact

Unauthorized Signer Registrations
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to register themselves or others as signers for arbitrary addresses without consent or validation.

System Integrity Compromise
The registration of unauthorized signers can manipulate critical processes dependent on signers, such as:

Multisig transactions.
Voting processes.
Other decision-making mechanisms relying on signer authenticity.
Potential for Collusion and Exploitation
Unauthorized registration can lead to:

Exploiting voting mechanisms to pass malicious proposals.
Taking control of a multisig wallet.
Undermining trust in the HatsSignerGate system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an authorization check in ```claimSignerFor``` to ensure msg.sender is allowed to register a hat for the specified _signer.
