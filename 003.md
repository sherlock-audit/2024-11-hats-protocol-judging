# Signer can avoid restrictions and change `safe` state variables

### Summary
In order to make sure that a delegatecall does not change Safe's state, HSG's `checkTransaction` stores the current threshold, owners list and fallback handler. Then, after the call is executed, `checkAfterExecution` is supposed to verify that these variables have not been changed.

```solidity
    if (operation == Enum.Operation.DelegateCall) {
      // case: DELEGATECALL
      // We disallow delegatecalls to unapproved targets
      if (!enabledDelegatecallTargets[to]) revert DelegatecallTargetNotEnabled();

      // Otherwise record the existing owners and threshold for post-flight checks to ensure that Safe state has not
      // been altered
      _existingOwnersHash = keccak256(abi.encode(owners));
      _existingThreshold = threshold;
      _existingFallbackHandler = safe.getSafeFallbackHandler();
```

However, since the `checkTransaction` can be re-entered by a new call, these restrictions can easily be bypassed. If the delegatecall changes the owners and the threshold, the executing signer can then just provide a new transaction to be executed with the new owners being just him and threshold set to 1. This will then override the above stored variables. Because of this the `checkAfterExecution`  check will also succeed.


### Root Cause

Possible reentrancy within `checkTransaction`

### Attack Path
1. Signers sign a tx which would alter the owners list and set the threshold to 1.
2. Within that `delegatecall`, the only remaining owner signs a new transaction and executes it. It doesn't realistically mater what the tx is.
3. `checkTransaction` is entered. `_existingOwnersHash ` and `_existingThreshold ` are overwritten to their new values.
4. The `checkAfterExecution` on both the inner and the outer call check against the altered values, hence they both succeed.
5. In the end, the intended restrictions are bypassed and the ownerlist and threshold are both overwritten.
6. The user who has remained the only owner has full access over the multi-sig until the other owners re-claim their hats.

### Impact
Users can bypassed intended restrictions not to be able to overwrite the owner list and threshold variables.

### Mitigation

If `checkTransaction` is entered, and the transient variables have already been assigned values, revert if the values differ from the current ones.
