# Signers can use old signatures/ repeat signatures in case the HSG guard adds new signers

### Summary
The order for a regular transaction is that it is first sent to the Safe, if the provided signatures reach the set threshold within the Safe, `checkTransaction` is called within the HSG. It must be noted that Safe only checks the first `threshold` signatures provided.

Then, within the `checkTransaction` function within HSG, before the owner list and the threshold are fetched,  a call to the guard is made

```solidity
    if (guard != address(0)) {
      BaseGuard(guard).checkTransaction(
        to,
        value,
        data,
        operation,
        // Zero out the redundant transaction information only used for Safe multisig transctions.
        0,
        0,
        0,
        address(0),
        payable(0),
        "",
        address(0)
      );
    }

    // get the existing owners and threshold
    address[] memory owners = safe.getOwners();
    uint256 threshold = safe.getThreshold();
```

Now, if that call does any logic which increases the current `threshold`, this would allow for usage of old signatures, or repeated signatures. One possible reason why the guard could do that would be 1) make sure there's no unregistered hat owners and register them 2) change the threshold config based on any outside logic. In either case, the appended signatures after the initial Safe threshold, could actually be repeated.

### Root Cause
Guard could increase the threshold and the last to be checked signatures are not actually verified. 

### Affected Code

### Attack Path
Consider the following scenario: 
1. The multi-sig always requires x/x signatures to execute tx
2. To properly enforce said rule, the HSG guard checks if there's a non-registered hat owner and registers them as a signer
3. Currently there are 3/3 registered signers willing to sign a tx. There's a 4th non-registered owner who has a signer hat.
4. The signers submit the tx to Safe with signatures `[Alice, Bob, John, Alice]`. 
5. Since the Safe's threshold is still 3, it only checks that the first three signatures are valid 
6. `checkTransaction` is entered. The guard registers the 4th hat owner as a signer and increases the threshold to 4.
7. HSG now checks 4 signatures. Since all of the signers are valid hat owners, the transaction succeeds.
8. The multi-sig managed to execute a tx with only 3 valid signatures, although 4 were originally needed.

### Impact
DAOs can execute transaction with less than threshold valid signatures.

### Mitigation
Make sure the Guard does not increase neither of the number of owners and the threshold.
