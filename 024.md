# setUp contract using exist safe wallet not enable HSG as guard and module

### Summary

1. setUp contract using exist safe wallet not enable HSG as guard and module, which break invariants in the `Details` page  

### Root Cause

setUp contract using exist safe wallet instead of create a new safe wallet

### Internal pre-conditions

1.using exsit safe wallet
2.add `getStorageAt` function to ISafe interface

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1.break the invariants

### PoC

From the detail we can see the invariants:
<https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/614?filter=questions>
>HSG should always be the guard of the safe (except when detaching itself)
>HSG should always be enabled as a module of the safe (except when detaching itself)

However when using an exist safe wallet the guard and module is not checked during setUp
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L160-L199>

Test:
```solidity
  function test_setUp_Exist_Safe() public {
    super.setUp();
    // create the instance deployer
    DeployInstance instanceDeployer = new DeployInstance();

    address[] memory owners = new address[](1);
    owners[0] = address(this);
    ISafe safeExist = _deploySafe(owners,1,1);
    // set up the deployment with the same parameters as the existing HSG (except for the nonce)
    instanceDeployer.prepare1(
      address(implementationHSG),
      ownerHat,
      signerHats,
      thresholdConfig,
      address(safeExist),
      false,
      false,
      address(0), // no guard
      new address[](0) // no modules
    );
    instanceDeployer.prepare2(true, 1);

    // deploy the instance
    newHSG = instanceDeployer.run();

    bytes memory currentGuard = safeExist.getStorageAt(uint256(keccak256("guard_manager.guard.address")),1);
    console2.log(abi.decode(currentGuard, (address)));
  }
```

out:
```shell
[PASS] test_setUp_Exist_Safe() (gas: 20246156)
Logs:
  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 3.21s (1.59s CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 3.21s (3.21s CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```
From above output we can see current the address of `guard` is zero


### Mitigation

Checking if the exist safe already set `HSG` as guard and module
