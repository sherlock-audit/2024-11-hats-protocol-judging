# The same signature can be use multiple times to pass the threshold

### Summary

In the `_countValidSignatures` function, a malicious signer can send the same signature multiple times in the `signatures` parameter.

### Root Cause

In [`HatsSignerGate.sol:656-683`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L656-L683), there is a missing check that the signature has already been used.

The function is inspired of the one from the safe wallet to validate transactions but safe function has this check:
```solidity
if (currentOwner <= lastOwner || owners[currentOwner] == address(0) || currentOwner == SENTINEL_OWNERS)
                revertWithError("GS026");
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The malicious signer should be a valid owner. The issue is that only one valid signature is enough to pass the threshold.

### Attack Path

1. A valid signer send signatures with the same signature multiple times as `signatures` parameters.
2. The `checkTransaction` calls the internal `_countValidSignatures` function.
3. The function does not revert, count the same signature multiple times as valid and a malicious transaction is validated.

### Impact

A malicious signer can bypass the threshold security.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Create a mapping variable checking if the signer has already sign the message during the call.
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) hasSigned;
```
And in the loop something like this:
```solidity
      if (isValidSigner(currentOwner) && !hasSigned[keccak256(abi.encode(currentOwner, dataHash))]) {
        // shouldn't overflow given reasonable sigCount
        unchecked {
          ++validSigCount;
        }
        hasSigned[keccak256(abi.encode(currentOwner, dataHash))] = true;
      }
```
