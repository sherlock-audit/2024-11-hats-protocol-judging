# Signers can frontrun `Safe.exectransaction()` when using delegatecalls to make it Revert.

### Summary

Malicious Signers and hat wearers can use `removeSigner()` , `claimSigner()` to grief `Safe.exectransaction()` when using delegatecalls.

### Root Cause

Safe's `Safe.execTransaction()` calls function `HSG::checkAfterExecution()` which is used to check If the transaction did not maliciously affect the safe, However in case of delegatecall transactions `HSG::checkAfterExecution()` calls `HSG::_checkSafeState()` which has an inbuilt check for change in number of owners:-
```sol 
if (keccak256(abi.encode(_safe.getOwners())) != _existingOwnersHash) revert CannotChangeOwners();
```

If A signer renounces their hat and calls `removeSigner()` and frontruns `execTransaction()` It would change number of owners causing above check to fail and make transaction revert.
A wearer of Hat can also use `claimSigner()` to achieve the same.

### Internal pre-conditions

TX uses Delegatecall operation.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Wait for `Safe.execTransaction()` using a delegatecall to appear in TxPool
- Frontrun Tx by using `removeSigner()` or `claimSigner()`.
- `_checkSafeState()` would fail and Tx would revert.

### Impact

Griefing of Users, Bad UX.
