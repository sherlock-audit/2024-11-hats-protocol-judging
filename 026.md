# There is no implementation or mechanism to unlock the `HatsSignerGate` contract.

## Summary
The `HatsSignerGate` contract does not implement a mechanism to unlock the contract once it is locked.

##Vulnerability Details

The vulnerabilities that arise are as follows:-

1.  If the owner locks the contract for any purpose, such as to disable a specific function, it cannot be unlocked later because no unlocking mechanism has been implemented.
2.  If the contract is locked for any purpose or function, the `migrateToNewHSG` function will also be locked, making migration to a new HSG impossible, because the `migrateToNewHSG` function check that contract is locked or not.

## Code lines  :-

## Impact :-

Once the contract is locked it will never be unlocked and the migration to other HSG will also not be possible.

## Recommendations :-
Implement a new unlock function in the contract .
`locked` is a global storage variable already defined in the contract.

The Following chnages in the   `HatsSignerGate` contract.
```solidity
    function unLock() public {
    _checkOwner();
    _unlock();
  }

  function _unlock() internal {
    locked = false;
    emit HSGunLocked();
  }
 ```
And in the `IHatsSignerGate` interface 
```solidity
    event HSGunLocked();
```
