# Wrong pragma

### Summary

The pragma used in `HatsSignerGate.sol` is:
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.13;
```

But the usage of transient keyword makes the pragma wrong.

### Root Cause

In [`HatsSignerGate.sol:2`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-hats-protocol/blob/main/hats-zodiac/src/HatsSignerGate.sol#L2), the pragma is false since the compiler will not understand the transient keyword for solidity versions <0.8.27

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The compiler will not be able to compile depending on the pragma version.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change pragma to:
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.27;
```

For judging:

Some people will invalidate because of this rule:

> Using Solidity versions that support EVM opcodes that don't work on networks on which the protocol is deployed is not a valid issue because one can manage compilation flags to compile for past EVM versions on newer Solidity versions.

But note that here it is different: the compiler will not work for most of compiler versions. It is not due to opcodes that don't work on networks on which the protocol is deployed.
