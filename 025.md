# # Signature malleability in `HatsSignerGate._countValidSignatures`

# Description

The `HatsSignerGate._countValidSignatures` function uses the EVM's built-in `ecrecover` function to count the number of valid signatures. However, `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability which allows signatures to be slightly modified while still being valid, even without having the private key.

Since number of valid signature check happens in `HatsSignerGate.checkTransaction` which runs before any Safe transaction executes, an attacker could potentially:

1. Take a valid signature
2. Modify it slightly to create a new valid signature
3. Use this to replay an old transaction that was already executed

# Code Snippet

# Impact

Replaying safe's transaction is possible to replay previously signed transactions

# Recommendation

Consider using OpenZeppelinâ€™s ECDSA library.
